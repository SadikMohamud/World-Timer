# 🌍 TimeScroll

**TimeScroll** is a responsive **World Clock web application** that displays the current time across multiple global cities in real time.  
Built using **HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript**, this was my **second project for Code Institute**, with a strong emphasis on improving my **JavaScript skills**. TimeScroll emphasizes clean structure, accessibility, interactivity, and real-world development practices.

## 📌 Project Overview

TimeScroll allows users to view the current time in different cities around the world simultaneously.  
The application updates automatically, and users can:

- Search for cities dynamically  
- Toggle **dark mode** for a modern UI  
- View the time across multiple devices thanks to a **fully responsive design**  

This project was developed as part of my **Code Institute learning journey**, focusing on:

- Building responsive HTML/CSS layouts  
- Strengthening JavaScript skills (DOM manipulation, search functionality, dark mode toggle)  
- Debugging deployment issues like case-sensitive paths on GitHub Pages  
- Testing across multiple devices and browsers

## 🚀 How It Works

- JavaScript uses the `Date` object to calculate current times  
- Time zones are handled using UTC offsets  
- DOM updates dynamically at regular intervals  
- Search functionality filters cities in real time  
- Dark mode toggle switches CSS classes dynamically  
- Scripts are loaded with `defer` to ensure the DOM is ready before execution
